Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
	i. 	Attribute table =	10000
	ii. 	Business table =	10000
	iii. 	Category table =	10000
	iv. 	Checkin table =		10000
	v. 	elite_years table =	10000
	vi. 	friend table = 		10000
	vii. 	hours table =		10000
	viii. 	photo table = 		10000
	ix. 	review table = 		10000
	x. 	tip table = 		10000
	xi. 	user table =		10000

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, 
   please specify which foreign key.

	i. 	Business =		10000 	(ID)
	ii. 	Hours =			1562 	(BUSINESS_ID)
	iii. 	Category =		2643    (BUSINESS_ID)
	iv. 	Attribute =		1115	(BUSINESS_ID)
	v. 	Review =		10000	(ID), 8090 (BUSINESS_ID), 9581 (USER_ID)
	vi. 	Checkin = 		493 	(BUSINESS_ID)
	vii. 	Photo =			10000	(ID), 6493 (BUSINESS_ID)
	viii. 	Tip = 			537	(USER_ID), 3979 (BUSINESS_ID)
	ix. 	User = 			10000	(ID)
	x. 	Friend = 		11	(USER_ID)
	xi. 	Elite_years =	        2780	(USER_ID)

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
   Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

	In this chance i will pick city "Las Vegas" and category "Shopping"

	SQL code:
		SELECT CASE
		WHEN B.stars>=4 THEN "4-5 STARS"
		WHEN (B.stars>=2 AND B.stars<=3) THEN "2-3 STARS"
		END RATING
		,B.NAME
		,COUNT(H.HOURS) AS WORK_DAY
		,SUM(B.REVIEW_COUNT) AS TOTAL_REVIEW
		,B.POSTAL_CODE
		FROM BUSINESS B
		INNER JOIN CATEGORY C
		ON B.ID=C.BUSINESS_ID
		INNER JOIN HOURS H
		ON B.ID=H.BUSINESS_ID
		WHERE B.CITY = "Las Vegas"
		AND C.CATEGORY = "Shopping"
		AND RATING <> "NONE"
		GROUP BY RATING

	Result:
		+-----------+--------------------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
		| RATING    | name                     | WORK_DAY | TOTAL_REVIEW | postal_code |
		+-----------+--------------------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
		| 2-3 STARS | Walgreens                |        7 |           42 | 89121       |
		| 4-5 STARS | Desert Medical Equipment |       12 |          244 | 89118       |
		+-----------+--------------------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Answer:
		Yes it has different distribution of hours;
		Business with 2-3 stars has total working hours of 7 day
		Business with 4-5 stars has total owrking hours of 12 day

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	Answer:
		Yes it has different number of reviews;
		Business with 2-3 stars has total review of 244
		Business with 4-5 stars has total review of 42

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	Answer:
		Yes it has different location from the postal_code provided;
		Business with 2-3 stars has the location with postal_code 89121
		Business with 4-5 stars has the location with postal_code 89118

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the 
   ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
	SQL code:
		SELECT
		CASE
		WHEN IS_OPEN = 0 THEN "CLOSED"
		WHEN IS_OPEN = 1 THEN "STILL OPEN"
		END STATUS
		,COUNT(IS_OPEN) AS TOTAL_OPEN
		,SUM(REVIEW_COUNT) AS TOTAL_REVIEW
		FROM BUSINESS
		GROUP BY IS_OPEN;

	Result:
		+------------+------------+--------------+
		| STATUS     | TOTAL_OPEN | TOTAL_REVIEW |
		+------------+------------+--------------+
		| CLOSED     |       1520 |        35261 |
		| STILL OPEN |       8480 |       269300 |
		+------------+------------+--------------+

i. Difference 1: There is still open 8480 business and there is already 1520 business closed
           
ii. Difference 2: The total review of open business is 269300 and for the closed one is only 35261

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset 
   and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	Answer: The analysis is to find out the top 10 of the most successful businesses based on the city.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
	Answer: We will need data of city, stars, and review count from the business table. We will need to count the numbers of business companies within each city, 
	the average stars given by the consumers to see how they perform, and the total reviews given to see if the data is relevant and ensure it’s not biased.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
	Answer:
